Impedance-Data based classification of Normal and cancer cells using Hilbert Haung Transform 
This paper explores different parameters for differentiation of two types of cancer cells namely MCF-7 (breast cancer cells), and MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer cells) with HaCaT (normal cells). Hilbert haung transform (HHT) (applied on impedence data of these cells) analysis is presented in this paper which clearly discriminates among them by decomposing the signal into several intrinsic modes functions. Cellular energy for cancer cells is found to higher. Several other parameters like entropy, correlation and dominating frequency is also explored. Over previous methods like wavelet and Fourier analysis Instantaneous frequency information is also obtained in this case. Cellular energy over different phase i.e. cell Death, Confluence and growing is obtained.
